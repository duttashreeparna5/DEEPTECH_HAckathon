# DEEPTECH_HAckathon
# UNIP – Wafer Defect Classification (IESA Deep Tech Hackathon)

This project uses a ResNet18 deep learning model to classify semiconductor wafer defects from grayscale images.

## Features
- Train / Validation / Test split (70/15/15)
- ResNet18 (modified for grayscale input)
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix
- Grad-CAM visualization for explainability
