# UNIP – AI-Based Wafer Defect Detection (IESA Deep Tech Hackathon)

UNIP is a deep learning–based system designed to automatically detect and classify semiconductor wafer defects using grayscale image analysis. The solution is built for the **IESA Deep Tech Hackathon** and focuses on accuracy, explainability, and industrial relevance.

---

##  Problem Statement

Manual inspection of semiconductor wafers is:

* Time-consuming
* Error-prone
* Expensive at scale

Defects like cracks, contamination, or pattern irregularities can significantly reduce yield. UNIP automates this inspection using computer vision and deep learning.

---

## Solution Overview

UNIP uses a **ResNet18 CNN model**, modified for grayscale wafer images, to classify multiple defect types. The pipeline includes:

* Automated training with Train / Validation / Test split
* Robust evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
* Explainability using **Grad-CAM** for defect localization

---

## Model Architecture

* Backbone: **ResNet18**
* Input: Grayscale wafer images (1-channel)
* Image size: 256 × 256
* Output: Multi-class defect classification
